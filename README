FAKE NEWS PREDICTOR 

This fake news predictor was a project in one of my subjects in school.

Steps to use the Predictor

1. Run The Model File.py. There are three models on the model file, PA Classifier, Logistic Regression Model and Multimonial NB Model. You can change between pipeline1, pipeline2 and pipeline3 in the very last command in order to choose the particular model you want the program to work with.
2. Run app.py which is the flask app, it gives you a URL with the port number.
3. Navigate to the page on a web browser using the URL and the port number.
4. When the page loads, it shows where you can type in the URL of the news you wish to analyse.
